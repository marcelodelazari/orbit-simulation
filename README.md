# orbit-simulation

### Solar system 2D orbit simulation using real world variables.
#### Celestial bodies size are out of proportion. Masses and equivalent distances to the Sun are maintained.
#### One second in the simulation is equivalent to 60 days in real world.
#### Due to enormous magnitudes, it wouldn't be possible to represent all of the planets in one screen while maintaining respective distances.
#### The numbers represents the planet's distance to the Sun in meters.
